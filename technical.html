                    <p>This project aims to estimate the number of houses sold in a one year period for a given Texas county.</p>
                    <p>Through the use of a linear regression machine learning model, users can input a valid Texas county and a price point. The model will return the approximate number of homes that will be sold at that price point in the county. </p>

                    <p>This machine learning model takes the biomedical voice information of a patient and predicts whether they are at risk for Parkinson's disease. The classification was perfomred using the Support Vector Model and its Linear kernel. I used Standard Scaler to scale the training and test data in an attempt to increase the accuracy score.</p>

                    <p>My current SQLite clone uses a B-Tree data structure to efficiently perform operations in O(log n) time. Operations supported include searches, inserts, and deletions. Data is organized into pages that consist of serialized rows and each row includes a field for an ID, username, and email. The pages are cached in the memory and through the use of the get_page function, memory is dynamically allocated to grow the database when required.</p>
