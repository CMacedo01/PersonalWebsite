                <p>My name is Christian Macedo and I am a Computer Science major with a minor in Statistics at Texas A&M. I was born in Lakeland, Florida on October 7th, 2003, but my family moved to Houston, Texas when I was about one year old. My childhood was filled with the usual oddities of a child, such as the time my cousin and I dropped a four wheeler on top of ourselves or the time I got stung by a caterpillar in front of the whole class in Kindergarten. I have had dreams and aspirations since I was a child, and while I do think they were more ambitious than most children’s dreams, I never really committed myself to any of them. In middle school, I thought that I wanted to become a hacker and spent weeks trying to learn how to navigate through certain Linux distributions and understand their tools, but my discipline was lacking at the time and I didn’t get very far into my journey. Shortly after starting high school, I tried disassembling old electronics in order to tinker with their components, but my lack of knowledge left me with useless circuit boards and a mess of wires. The financial status of my parents at the time made me unwilling to ask them to purchase tools and other electronics off  of the internet, though I think that if I had the courage to ask them, I might’ve learned a lot more about electronics. My passion for architecture quickly dissipated in high school once I was hit with the reality of such a career, and it was reignited in programming when I took a computer science course my junior year in a class of two. Since then, my ambition and my discipline have really taken off, and I find it much easier to commit to my almost impossible dreams. To this day, I continue to improve my mindset so that I can advance further in my goals and achieve the dreams of my younger self. </p>
